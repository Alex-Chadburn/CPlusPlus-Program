  **Project Summary**
This project involved writing a C++ program to calculate and display annual bank interest with and without monthly deposits in a formatted manner. 
The primary problem it addressed was to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. 

Achievements
One aspect I did particularly well was ensuring the accuracy of the interest calculations and presenting the results in a user-friendly format. 
The program effectively handles various input scenarios and provides clear, formatted output that is easy to understand.

Areas for Improvement
There are several areas where the code could be enhanced:
Efficiency: Implementing more efficient algorithms for interest calculation could reduce the programâ€™s runtime, especially for large datasets. (pow instead of a for loop)
Modularity: Refactoring the code to improve modularity would make it easier to maintain and extend. For example, separating the interest calculation logic from the user interface code.

Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging part is often getting started, I have heard and it is often true is that big problems are just a lot of smaller problems.
This is why it is always a great idea to come up with a flowchart or psuedocode first before implementing anything, even a UML is great.
There were many challenges one of my personal favorites was the formatting, I made it look the exact same as what I was provided, however looking back on it, I definitely overcomplicated the process.

Transferable Skills
The skills I developed during this project, such as file formats(cpp, headers), debugging, and user interface formatting, are highly transferable to other projects and coursework.
These skills will be particularly useful in any future work involving data presentation, and in general my maintainability and adaptability.

Maintainability and Adaptability
To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed best practices such as:

Clear Documentation: Adding comments and documentation throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of different sections.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Using consistent and descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions.
Code Modularity: Structuring the code into functions and classes to separate concerns and make it easier to update or extend specific parts of the program.
